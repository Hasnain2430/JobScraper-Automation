# JobScraper - Automation

This project is a web scraping tool designed to automate the search for AI/ML job opportunities on popular job portals such as [Rozee.pk](https://www.rozee.pk/) and [Indeed](https://pk.indeed.com/). The tool utilizes Selenium to gather key job listing information and organizes it into a structured dataset for easy analysis.

## Features

- Scrapes job listings for AI/ML Engineer positions from Rozee.pk and Indeed.
- Collects essential details such as job title, company name, location, gender preference, education level, degree, experience, job type, and salary (if available).
- Saves the data in CSV files for further analysis and filtering.
- Filters jobs based on location (e.g., recommends jobs in Islamabad).
- Automation for multi-page scraping on Indeed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hasnain2430/AI-ML-Job-Scraper.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and set up [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) (or use WebDriver Manager for automated setup).

## Usage

1. Open the main script (`job_scraper.py`) in a Jupyter Notebook or similar environment.
2. Run each cell in sequence to start scraping job listings from Rozee.pk and Indeed.
3. The tool will open a browser window, navigate to the job portals, and start collecting data for AI/ML Engineer positions.

4. Once complete, two CSV files will be created:
   - `Rozee_Data.csv`: Contains job listings from Rozee.pk.
   - `Indeed_Data.csv`: Contains job listings from Indeed.

5. To filter jobs by location (e.g., Islamabad), use the filtering code provided at the end of the script.

## Data Fields

The tool collects the following data fields:

### Rozee.pk
- **Job Title**: Title of the job position.
- **Company Name**: Name of the hiring company.
- **Job Location(s)**: Location of the job.
- **Gender Preference**: If specified, the preferred gender for the role.
- **Minimum Education**: Minimum education level required.
- **Degree Level**: Specific degree requirements (if available).
- **Experience**: Required years of experience.
- **Link**: Direct link to the job listing.

### Indeed
- **Job Title**: Title of the job position.
- **Company Name**: Name of the hiring company.
- **Job Location(s)**: Location of the job.
- **Job Type**: Type of job (e.g., full-time, part-time).
- **Salary**: Salary range (if specified).
- **Link**: Direct link to the job listing.

## Example Output

The output is saved in CSV format and can be imported into any data analysis tool (e.g., Pandas, Excel) for further processing. Hereâ€™s an example of filtering for jobs located in Islamabad:

```python
df2 = pd.read_csv('Indeed_Data.csv')
filtered_df2 = df2[df2['Job Location(s)'].str.contains('Islamabad', case=False)]
print("Recommended Job(s) in Islamabad:")
filtered_df2
```
